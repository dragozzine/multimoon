TODOs for the MultiMoon Project
Darin Ragozzine, Seth Pincock, Dallin Spencer, Ben Proudfoot 

Most specific coding TODOs are listed in the individual files with 
initials for the assigned person. This list is for more medium and 
long-term TODOs. It is divided into code and science. Anyone can add 
to it, but note that this may become public someday. A rough 
timeframe for when this might be needed can be listed.


TODO

MultiMoon version 1.1

- Includesun: Include the sun in your integration of the system (introduce solar perturbations to the system). 

- Automated tolerance testing

MultiMoon version 2.0

- Photocenter-barycenter shift: Include photocenter-barycenter offset in the case of a >3 body system with a tight inner body. Less complex than a full PSF fit, we check to see if the center of the primary body moves around, due to the photometric addition of the inner body. A relative brightness can be estimated with this method. 

- nPSF integration with MultiMoon. In the case of tight inner body's, perform a PSF fit to the data with the estimated seperation for the best fit.




Code that reads in entire Grundy database, but work with Grundy on 
this (to get proprietary data he's willing to share too). (August?)

Update likelihood function to use outputs from nPSF. nPSF should 
probably have an additional post-processing calculation that calculates 
likelihoods on a grid and thinks ahead to how the likelihood for an 
arbitrary value would be calculated.





SCIENCE TODOs
See HST proposals
See SSW proposal

Check what J2 would be necessary for the incorrect mean motion to 
significantly affect the mass/density estimate. Equal mass contact 
binaries at what separation would lead to a 10% offset? Analytical 
estimates could be made based on Ragozzine & Wolf 2009 or Emelyanov 
et al. 2009.
