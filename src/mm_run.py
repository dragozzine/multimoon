# Run with 
# python mm_run.py args
# where args are some combination of input and output file names TBD



# - Input: filename that is a JSON text file version of run_props dictionary
# - Output: directly, information about the success of the run
# - Output: indirectly: posterior, plots, etc.

#Works with run_props dictionary
# - Reads in run_props dictionary (from JSON)
# - Adds information autogenerated for this specific run
# - Checks other information

#Generates Initial Guess
#Make param_to_fit_scale: a parameters dataframe with the scale we'll use for converting to the fit values
#default: param_to_fit_scale is the first row of the init_guess dataframe
# - that way, every system and every parameter is pretty naturally scaled automatically!

#Checks if geocentric_object_position.csv already exists; if not, creates it; then reads it in and stores it #somewhere global

#Opens obsdata file and puts it into dataframe and stores it somewhere global

#Initializes Run
#Chooses prior and likelihood methods

#Runs emcee

#Takes posterior from emcee, thins, converts from fit_array to posterior dataframe in parameter format
#Saves posterior dataframe to designated output file

#Makes requested plots
