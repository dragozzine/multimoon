mm_run: This file runs the multimoon program. It pulls together all of the functions and files in each the project and runs them using the information given by the user in the runprops files.


mm_runprops: This file reads in the runprops text file so that the set run properties can be used over and over. 



SUPPORT FILES:
runprops.txt: This text file contains all of the vairables that will be used in nearly every function of multimoon. It is read in as a dictionary using JSON methods.

mm_testsupport: This file is used to test the different files and functions of multimoon. Is not used in the final run phase.
