FILE DESCRIPTIONS:


Haumea_spins_sim.gif - Shows the rotation of the three bodies of the Haumea system. The bodies' sizes are scaled for visibility. The proportions of Haumea are accurate, but Namaka and Hi'iaka are just guesses. The simulation lasts for about one orbital period of Namaka.

Lempo_spins_sim.gif - similar to the one for Haumea. This simulation worked off of the assumption that all three bodies are tidally locked and axes are aligned with their orbits. The simulation lasts for about 15 days

Pluto_spins_sim.gif - Same as the other two. The simulation lasts for about 2 periods of Plutoâ€“Charon.

Lempo-50yr.gif - this shows the evolution of the spin (Z) axes over longer periods of time, so the X and Y axes aren't shown. Again, the assumption was that the bodies are tidally locked

Pluto-100yr.gif - similar to the Lempo one, except the simulation runs for 100 years to better show the chaotic spins.

Lempo_Simulation.gif - a basic simulation of the orbits of the Lempo system, using the elements from Benecchi 2010. 

Pluto_Simulation.gif - simulation of the orbits of the Pluto system. I mostly just made this one to test SPINNY's/VPython's capabilities, but it is interesting to show that not all of the moons' orbits are closed.
