# Eris Observations

Please note any changes to data files here!

Eris_obs_df.csv -- Added on 06/17/21 by Ben Prooudfoot. Contains all Eris data which is currently
                   publically available. This combines the observations from Holler et al. 2021, 
                   as well as the observations published in Brown and Schaller 2007.
                   This data is in Geocentric True Ecliptic coordinates, which should match 
                   MultiMoon's coordinate system. 
                -- New data file with small (a few milliarcsecond) changes due to a bug in the latlon
		   tranformation code. 06/30/21

Eris_obs_df_w_Herc.csv -- IDentical to Eris_obs_df.csv, but with columns for NaN values of Hercule's astrometry
