# Haumea Observations

Please note any changes to data files here!

Haumea_obs_df.csv -- Added on 06/17/21 by Ben Prooudfoot. Contains all Haumea data currently reduced
                     combining new HST data from DR and the data reported in Ragozzine and Brown 2009.
                     This data is in Geocentric True Ecliptic coordinates, which should match 
                     MultiMoon's coordinate system. 
		  -- New data file with small (a few milliarcsecond) changes due to a bug in the latlon
		     tranformation code. 06/30/21
