TODOs for the MultiMoon Project
Darin Ragozzine, Seth Pincock, Dallin Spencer, Ben Proudfoot 

Most specific coding TODOs are listed in the individual files with 
initials for the assigned person. This list is for more medium and 
long-term TODOs. It is divided into code and science. Anyone can add 
to it, but note that this may become public someday. A rough 
timeframe for when this might be needed can be listed.


TODO

DS - Test/Ensure that a single user can run the code multiple times simultaneously, even in the same directory, 
without running into issues. UPDATE: You can, and it works great.

SP: Code that takes binary orbital angles in equatorial (RA/Dec) and calculate 
what these would be in ecliptic (Long/Lat). Could potentially also do 
the analytical calculation of the mirror degeneracy orbital angles as 
well. (June)

Keep track (probably in runprops) of current best set of parameters and 
log-likelihood and when a better log-likelihood is found, output to a 
text file.

Have a non-auto version that can be set with a flag that just runs it a 
fixed number of times.

Code that reads in entire Grundy database, but work with Grundy on 
this (to get proprietary data he's willing to share too). (August?)

Update likelihood function to use outputs from nPSF. nPSF should 
probably have an additional post-processing calculation that calculates 
likelihoods on a grid and thinks ahead to how the likelihood for an 
arbitrary value would be calculated.





SCIENCE TODOs
See HST proposals
See SSW proposal

Check what J2 would be necessary for the incorrect mean motion to 
significantly affect the mass/density estimate. Equal mass contact 
binaries at what separation would lead to a 10% offset? Analytical 
estimates could be made based on Ragozzine & Wolf 2009 or Emelyanov 
et al. 2009.
